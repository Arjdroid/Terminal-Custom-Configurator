# dotfiles
A repository that contains my preferred configurations for different tools such as UNIX shells, Terminal applications, and Code Editors </h2>

## Overview

This repo has been made to my _personal_ terminal customisation preferences, containing dotfiles for exactly how I want my configuration. It's open source so you may fork this repository to make a configuration exactly how you want it. Pull requests and issues are quite welcome, especially for critical bugs or vulnerabilities.

The only operating systems I test are the latest macOS, Fedora, and Windows versions.
> Note: The customisations implemented here are quite heavy and definitely not optimised for low CPU / GPU utilisation but rather aesthetic preference - it is not ideal for 'minimal' distro setups or lower spec systems as some pieces are currently, unfortunately CPU and Memory intensive. In the future, I plan to also add .bashrc modifications to make it lighter and mimic the zsh appearance for use in minimal server installs.
